# Each client has own database

- Status: proposed

## Context and Problem Statement

Due to GDPR we want to separate data for each SaaS user, so if user A asks 'to be forgotten' the process will be as simple as database deletion.


## Decision Drivers

- GDPR law to be forgotten
- better data separation
- simpler way of selecting/storing data
